# vulkan_cookbook_implementation

In this repository I will be implementing the content from the book :
Vulkan 3D Graphics Rendering Cookbook - Second Edition

this is basically my take, as I will be working in windows and ubuntu (wsl) for building the project.
the main editor will be vscode.
CMake will be the too for building the project.


## building commands and configuration:

  cd C:\DEV\vulkan_cookbook_implementation\VulkanEngine                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
  mkdir build                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  cd build                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
  cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
  cmake --build . --config Release
